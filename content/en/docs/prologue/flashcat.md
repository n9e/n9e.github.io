Nightingale's core development team is fully dedicated to open source. Without a sustainable income, the project cannot continue. Therefore, they founded a company: Beijing Flashcat Cloud Technology Co., Ltd., abbreviated as "Flashcat" and launched two commercial products:

- [One-stop Intelligent Observation Platform Flashcat](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/t2SgWFGBeiyJtJqvaQAkzw)
- [One-stop Alarm Response Platform Flashduty](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZYLboMRpV4HM4aKVvNZ59w)

Among them, Flashcat can be regarded as the commercial version of Nightingale, positioned as a unified observation platform, while the open-source version focuses only on metric monitoring. The differences between the two can be referenced in this article: ã€Š[Differences Between Nightingale Open Source Version and Commercial Version](https://flashcat.cloud/blog/flashcat-vs-n9e/)ã€‹.

FlashDuty is a one-stop alarm response platform similar to PagerDuty (i.e., On-call center), supporting integration with various monitoring systems such as Zabbix, Prometheus, Nightingale, cloud monitoring, Elastalert, etc. It consolidates alarm events into a single platform and unifies the processing of alarms, including convergence and noise reduction, scheduling, claim escalation, response, dispatch, and more.

The knowledge in the monitoring and observability field is indeed very complex. If you have the budget and need third-party assistance, you can consider Flashcat's products for a win-win situation ðŸ‘‰ [Free product idea exchange with Flashcat](https://flashcat.cloud/contact/).
