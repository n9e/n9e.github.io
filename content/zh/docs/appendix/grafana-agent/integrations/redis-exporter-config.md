grafana-agent内置了[`redis_exporter`](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter)，可以采集Redis server的运行指标。

目前grafana-agent，只支持配置一个Redis server地址，对其进行数据采集。如果您希望采集多个redis实例的metrics数据，那么需要启动多个grafana-agent实例，并通过`relabel_configs`来区分来自不同redis实例的数据。

# 配置并启用redis_exporter
```yaml
redis_exporter:
  enabled: true
  redis_addr: "redis-2:6379"
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
    replacement: redis-2
```

我们强烈推荐您使用独立的账号运行grafana-agent，并做好访问redis实例的最小化授权，避免过度授权带来的安全隐患，更多可以参考[official documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter#authenticating-with-redis)。
