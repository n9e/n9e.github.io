Similar to Grafana&amp;rsquo;s data source integration approach, Nightingale also integrates with various existing data sources. While Grafana focuses on visualization, Nightingale focuses on alerting.
Nightingale can query data from multiple data sources, generate alarm events, and then send alerts via various notification channels. In addition, we also have an event pipeline design, which can perform different processing on alarm events, such as filtering, relabeling, enriching, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Nightingale vs Prometheus</title><link>https://n9e.github.io/docs/prologue/prometheus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:12:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://n9e.github.io/docs/prologue/prometheus/</guid><description>Nightingale is similar to Grafana in that it can integrate with a variety of data sources, the most common of which is Prometheus-type. Other data sources that are compatible with the Prometheus interface, such as VictoriaMetrics, Thanos, and M3DB, can also be considered Prometheus-type sources, so the relationship between the two is close.
If you have the following requirements, you might consider using Nightingale:
You have multiple time-series databases, such as Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, and want to use a unified platform to manage various alert rules with permission control.</description></item></channel></rss>
